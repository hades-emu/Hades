## Features

Hades is still under heavy development but it aims to have a decent balance between usability, speed and accuracy.

Currently, Hades features:

  - Game controller support
  - Keys and buttons remapping
  - Quick Saves (also known as Save State)
  - Some GPIO devices, such as:
    - Real Time Clock (RTC)
    - Rumble
  - Color correction & LCD effects
  - Loading games from common archive formats (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`, etc.)

It is the third ðŸ¥‰ software emulator to pass the AGS Aging Cartridge used to test Game Boy Advance systems.
